# Covid19 Prediction and Analysis

## Introduction


- This project is divided into 2 parts
  1. Pneumonia detection from lung x-rays: COVID19 virus affects the respiratory system of healthy individual & Chest X-Ray is one of the important imaging methods      to identify Pneumonia caused due to corona virus.
